# Learning Locker for OpenShift 

## Getting Started

Create OpenShift resources corresponding to these objects:

1) Create the image stream for learning-locker in app/ directory.
1) Create the buildconfig in app/ directory.
1) Kick off a build of learning-locker image.
1) Create the proxy (Nginx) deployment and config map resources (we'll deal with SSL later...) inside proxy/ directory and config subdirectory.
1) Create the UI and API deployments.
